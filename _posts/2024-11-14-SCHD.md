## What is Dividend Investing? 

Dividend investing is a strategy focused on buying stocks of companies that regularly pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. The goal is to generate a steady stream of income while also benefiting from potential capital appreciation.

## Introducing the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)

## How to Invest in SCHD

SCHD can be purchased through most online brokers. As with any investment, it's important to consider your overall portfolio allocation and risk tolerance before investing. Dividend ETFs like SCHD can serve as a core holding for income-oriented investors or as a way to diversify an existing portfolio.

## Risks and Considerations 

- **Market Risk**: Like all stock investments, SCHD is subject to market fluctuations and can lose value during downturns.

- **Sector Concentration Risk**: SCHD's portfolio is heavily weighted towards certain sectors, which could lead to underperformance if those sectors face challenges. 

- **Dividend Cuts**: While SCHD focuses on companies with a history of paying dividends, there's no guarantee these companies will maintain or increase their dividends in the future.

Despite these risks, SCHD remains an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to high-quality, dividend-paying U.S. stocks. With its low costs, diversified portfolio, and strong performance record, SCHD is a solid choice for long-term investors looking to generate income and potentially benefit from capital appreciation.
