# Cryptography - Caesar Cipher

![Caesar Cipher](/img/Caesar_circle.png)

- The **Caesar cipher (or Caesar code)** is one of the simplest substitution ciphers, which encrypts plaintext by shifting the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.
- The name of this cipher originates from the **encryption method used by Julius Caesar** in ancient Rome.

- For example, if we shift the string 'ABC' by 3 positions, it becomes 'DEF'. The alphabetical order must be maintained between the characters before and after the shift. Therefore, shifting 'Z' by 1 position should result in 'A'.

- The **Caesar cipher** was widely used in ancient Roman times and was considered relatively secure at that time.
- However, it can be easily decrypted using modern computers and brute-force attacks, making it an insecure encryption method.

- Nevertheless, the Caesar cipher is useful for understanding the basic concepts of cryptography, and various encryption methods have been developed based on its variations.
- For example, simply changing the shift value of 3 in the Caesar cipher for each encryption can easily increase the strength of the encryption.
- By applying these simple techniques, various encryption methods have been developed, which have served as the basis for more powerful encryption schemes.

## Code

```rs
pub fn encryption(
    string: &str, // The string to be encrypted
    shifts: u8,   // The shift value used in the Caesar cipher
    lang_arr: Vec<char>, // The character set to be used
    lang_arr_upper: Vec<char>, // The array of characters used to maintain the order of lang_arr
```

- string: The string to be encrypted.
- shifts: The shift value used in the Caesar cipher.
- lang_arr: The character set to be used.
- lang_arr_upper: The array of characters used to maintain the order of lang_arr.

```rs
 Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
```

- The function returns a Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>. If the returned value is Ok, it contains the encrypted string; if it is Err, it contains an error of a subtype of std::error::Error.

```rs
 let letters: HashMap<usize, &char> = lang_arr_upper.iter().enumerate().collect();
```

1. Create a HashMap called letters that stores the index of each character by enumerating lang_arr2.

```rs
 let numbers: HashMap<char, usize> = lang_arr
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(idx, chr)| (chr.clone(), idx))
        .collect();
```

2. Create a HashMap called numbers that stores each character and its index by enumerating lang_arr.

```rs
  Ok(string
        .chars()
        .map(|c| {
```

3. Convert the string to an iterator of char type using the chars() method.

- - Use the map() method to perform the Caesar cipher on each character of the string.

```rs
   if c == ' ' {// * If the character is a space, return it as is.
                c
```

- - If the character is a space, return it as is.

```rs
 let shift = numbers[&c] + shifts as usize;

                //* If the index after shifting exceeds the range of lang_arr, use the letters HashMap to wrap around the alphabet.
                if shift > lang_arr.len() - 1 {
                    // Change the letter shift to the remainder of the array size
                    *letters[&(shift % lang_arr.len())]
```

- - If the character is an alphabet, use the numbers HashMap to obtain the index of the character and shift it by shifts.

```rs
  if shift > lang_arr.len() - 1 {
```

- - If the index after shifting exceeds the range of lang_arr, use the letters HashMap to wrap around the alphabet.

```rs
 else {
                    // If wrapping around is not necessary, use the letters HashMap to convert the index to a character
                    *letters[&shift]
                }
```

- - If wrapping around is not necessary, use the letters HashMap to convert the index to a character.

```rs
  .collect::<String>())
```

4. Use the collect() method to generate the encrypted string.
